The projects are chosen based on the subdomain.
In order to be able to work with subdomains on a local test environment, you need to edit the
hosts etc file.
Example (Windows):
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
127.0.0.1	adonai.localhost

As a default "example" will be taken --> (data/projects/example).
